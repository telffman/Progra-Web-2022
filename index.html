          <h5 class="center">Enjoying life since 1998</h5>
          <p class="large">
            ProyectoCava was founded in 2022 by Tomas Elffman. We hope to
            embrace wine lovers in this on-line space designed with love and
            style. You'll find here detailed lists for discovering new wines,
            wineries, varieties and more. Enjoy yourself, drink wine and keep
            calm, theres wine in the cellar ðŸ˜‰
          </p>
          <p class="large text-grey hide-medium">
            There is much more to wine than just fermented fruit juice. From
            where and how the grapes are grown to the techniques used to turn
            them into wine to how we experience it in the glass.
          </p>
          <p class="large text-grey hide-medium">
            In its simplest form, wine doesnâ€™t require much at all. It is simply
            fermented grape juice and fermentation is a natural process that
            occurs with or without human intervention.
          </p>
          <p class="large text-grey hide-medium">
            What makes wine complex â€“ and extremely enjoyable â€“ is the potential
            to influence the winemaking process in many ways, and this is what
            gives us all different kinds and styles of wine. The fact is, you
            can technically make wine by letting a pile of grapes ferment in a
            bucket or your bathtub. But it probably wonâ€™t be wine you want to
            drink!

          <h1 class="center">Wine Varieties</h1>
          <br />
          <h4>Cabernet-Franc</h4>
          <p class="text-grey">
            Classic medium-bodied red with moderate tannins.
            nice balance between red fruits, herbs, and peppery earthiness. 
            Its medium-to-high acidity makes it refreshingly easy-to-drink.
            <div class="like_button_container" data-commentid="1"></div>
          </p>
          
          <h4>Malbec</h4>
          <p class="text-grey">
            Full-bodied and acidic, deep purple-red wine with juicy fruit flavors like plum and black cherry.
            The malbec grape is known for its inky dark color that express terroir well which means influences of soil, nutrients and climate appear in unique ways on the palate.
            <div class="like_button_container" data-commentid="2"></div>
          </p>

          <h4>Cabernet-Sauvignon</h4>
          <p class="text-grey">
            Well-structured and complex wines. Styles range from soft,
            approachable and elegant to powerful, plush and tannic.
            <div class="like_button_container" data-commentid="3"></div>
          </p>

          <h4>Pinot Noir</h4>
          <p class="text-grey">
            These elegant wines are often slightly translucent in colour, with a
            delicate mouthfeel and aromas of red berries, flowers and sometimes
            the savouriness of spice.
            <div class="like_button_container" data-commentid="4"></div>
          </p>

          <h4>Bonarda</h4>
          <p class="text-grey">
            Very fruity on the nose, with notes of black cherry and fresh blueberry which
            become more complex, giving off nuanced aromas of violets, 5-spice and allspice.
            On the palate, Bonarda has an initial burst of fruitiness, a medium-body, juicy acidity, and a smooth, low-tannin finish.
            <div class="like_button_container" data-commentid="5"></div>
          </p>

          <h4>Syrah</h4>
          <p class="text-grey">
            Boasting rich flavours, high tannin and high alcohol content, these
            wines are bold, dark and rich. They get their deep colour and much
            of their flavour from the skin of the grapes.
            <div class="like_button_container" data-commentid="6"></div>
          </p>

          <h4>Blends</h4>
          <p class="text-grey">
            Different batches of wine can be mixed together before bottling to
            create a desired style and taste. For example, a winemaker might
            blend different varieties to achieve a more â€˜completeâ€™ and
            consistent wine, such as in GSM (Grenache Shiraz Mataro). Or they
            may blend different batches of the same variety to adjust acid or
            tannin levels.
